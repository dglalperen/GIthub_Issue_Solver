The issue reported is that the SDK is unable to connect with a provider like Google, despite being able to connect with email/password. The error message suggests that the resource cannot be located, which points to a possible issue with the URL being used to make the request. One possible solution is to ensure that the URL for the provider is correct and accessible, and that the SDK is configured to use the correct URL. It may also be helpful to consult the SDK's documentation or reach out to its development team for additional support in implementing OAuth2 authentication with Kratos and React Native.
